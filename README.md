# Flarum Issue Archive

In 2022, we decided to reset our open issues and milestones. You can read more about the reasoning behind this decision [in this announcement](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/29518-the-clean-slate-method-on-issues-and-pull-requests), but in short, the goal was to reduce administrative overhead, and give us an opportunity to re-evaluate Flarum's priorities, since we have been working on milestones first created in 2015-2016.

This repository holds the previously open issues from flarum/core for archival purposes. We expect it to be deleted eventually, but since some are still very relevant, we didn't want to close them all completely.
